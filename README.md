# py-ai-agent
AI Agent in Python, using LangChain Framework

This project was based from Alura Agent IA project, but I made some modifications to enhance its functionality and usability.

Link to the original project: [Alura Agent IA](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17CGpuWY0M1njllxWD_d6oyXAtA3p3Bs2?usp=sharing)

Example of questions you can ask the agent:
- "Posso reembolsar a internet?"
- "Posso reembolsar cursos ou treinamentos da Alura?"
- "Quantas capivaras tem no Rio Pinheiros?"
